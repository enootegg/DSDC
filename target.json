When she falls in love for the first time, a power that had laid dormant within her is unleashed. It’s a film that captures the heart, being filled with the beauty, the sadness, and the fear that comes with loving someone—with trying to connect to someone. Thelma is all about what it means to connect—and what it means to sever connections."

      "target": "One of the few things we have learnt about Bridge Babies is that they’re connected to their stillmothers via the Beach. It is thought that, in their brain-dead state, stillmothers’ wombs act as a kind of seam, allowing BBs to exist in a place between the worlds of the living and the dead. This may be why they can detect BTs, though that is pure speculation. It seems that BBs can use the umbilical cord connection to inform the person to whom they’re connected of what’s happening on the other side. We can’t plug them into simply anyone, though. Only people without DOOMS and people who aren’t so attuned to the other side make suitable BB partners. If we hooked a BB up to some DOOMS type who’s super-sensitive to the world of the dead, its balance would go all to pot. What’s more, BBs tend to increase one’s sensitivity to the other side—so if you tend to be rather sensitive already, it can all get a bit too much. To make life even more difficult, different BBs tend to prefer different people. They have…compatibility issues, I suppose you could say. That’s one of the reasons we can’t simply mass-produce them, you see. Yes, they’re awkward little things, but I’m an obstinate sort, and t+L196he awkwardness only makes me want to learn more about them..."

Our cultures and civilizations have been built with an awareness of our relationship with death—the extent to which we can accept and live with it. Out of fear of the inevitable decomposition and destruction of the flesh, our ancestors developed elaborate embalming techniques, death masks, and the like. Indeed, <color name=yellow>the mask has ever been a symbol of the soul that transcends this world to exist for eternity in the next</color>. The mummies and sarcophagi of ancient Egypt are but one instance of this. Honored individuals were given masks and placed inside sarcophagi in order to be preserved for eternity, thereby transcending death and attaining immortality.\nPaintings and photographs are no different, really. They are simply more modern variants of the Egyptians' masks and sarcophagi. Indeed, all of humanity's crowning achievements—art, language, writing—are arguably a reaction to death, and an expression of our desire to overcome it. They are great feats born from fear, and one might even go as far as to say that it was the primal fear of death that drove the evolution of our ancestors into homo sapiens in the first place.

Some BTs actively seek out human beings, while others attempt to draw us towards them. Still others are capable of consuming their prey, causing a voidout in the process. It is not only their roles and behavior that set them apart, however. Their physiology is also different. Moreover, we have anecdotal evidence suggesting the existence of some truly enormous BTs. Curiously, however, these ones do not appear to have umbilical cords.\nGiant BTs are comprised of the consolidated Ka of multiple deceased individuals. As a result, the connection between each individual and their Beach is lost, which is why the resulting BT does not manifest an umbilical cord--that's the theory, at any rate.\nUnfortunately, I doubt we'll be able to learn more about these entities until the chiral network is online--a day that can't come soon enough."

The theory was that it stemmed from a sense of being acknowledged. Even though you couldn't see the person you were interacting with, it still felt like they were accepting you, praising you. And who wouldn't like that?\nBut that same process is at the heart of the MULE phenomenon. It's believed that an overdependence on the oxytocin rush provided by these kinds of interactions is a factor in porters going rogue.

It was the president's. I saw her myself, plenty of times. Pretty much every time I did a night shift, actually, there she was, in the office or a corridor or something, just standing there. I tried calling out a couple times, but whenever I did she'd up and disappear. I'd say she—the ghost, I mean—was in her twenties, but I'm not kidding when I tell you she looked like a younger President Strand.\nAnd before you ask, there's no way it could have been an intruder. Couldn't have been the president herself, either. She was always sleeping whenever there was a sighting, and even if she hadn't been, no weird trick of the light could've made her look that much younger. I know it sounds crazy, but after a while we couldn't help but believe it was a ghost—either the president's, or that of someone else who was her spitting image.\nI knew I'd catch hell for it, but I just had to tell Die-Hardman. It was a security concern, for one thing, and for all we knew the president was sleepwalking or whatever. I was worried about her, too, truth be told, and I thought it was my duty to report it. Let me tell you, I sure as hell didn't expect the response I got. He told me, matter-of-fact, that the ghost was actually the president's daughter, Amelie. I didn't even know the president had a daughter! Even he'd only found out recently, he said, and had been waiting for the right time to tell us. Apparently she'd suffered from something known as locked-in syndrome from birth. Had been hospitalized for a ridiculously long time. The president hadn't shared it with anyone except her closest confidants, either.\nAnd then, after twenty years of treatment, Amelie had made a miraculous recovery. She was able to move around again. The president and her daughter had been living apart, but after her recovery Amelie came to join her mother at the residence. It was kept on a need-to-know basis at first. Just the head of the detail and some of the guards. I've never told anyone else about it...until now."

The procedure he was undertaking at the time, however, was slightly unusual, in that he was operating on a mother who had been declared brain-dead seven months into her pregnancy. She had been placed on life support, but since her blood pressure was decreasing and the fetus was showing signs of bradycardia, the decision was made to operate. Because the procedure was broadcast to medical researchers on a closed-circuit network, we are fortunate to have a record of what took place.\nPer the footage, the incision was made without incident. The plan was apparently to remove the fetus from the womb and immediately place it in a NICU, where it would receive the necessary care. Prior to this, the surgeon would of course have to cut the umbilical cord. This is the moment that changed everything—the moment the surgeon's hand touched the cord. In that instant he uttered his infamous last words: \"Who the hell!?\""

All the records of what came before will be at our fingertips once more. Which is not to say that we would be completely ignorant without the chiral network. Oh no, the world around us is full of information about the past if you know where to look.\nTake the various geological strata. They're a real treasure trove of knowledge. For example, earthquakes are known to produce white layers which intermingle with the existing strata. These are known as \"pseudotachylites\", and they are produced by the rapid movements within fault lines that occur during earthquakes. When there is displacement along a fault line, the frictional heat that is generated melts the surrounding rocks. As these rocks cool and harden, they come to resemble the basaltic glass known as tachylite. Hence \"pseudotachylites\". Therefore, one need only look for these telltale signs to learn when and where ancient earthquakes occurred.\nThat is but one simple example, of course. The earth beneath our feet holds a comprehensive record of everything that has ever happened on this planet—the big five extinctions included. Study them, and we might unravel the mystery of the Death Stranding, too."

Or, to posit a more radical theory, could the very concepts of power and society themselves have emerged solely to facilitate the creation of such monuments, such challenges to the finality of death? Either way, in leaving behind something they hoped might endure through the ages, the builders of these edifices believed that they too might live on forever. \nThe mummies of the Egyptians are another means by which man sought to fulfill this desire to escape the finality of death.

A woven web of threads said to protect the mind from harm by trapping nightmares, thus ensuring that only pleasant dreams pass through.\nIt is no coincidence that these charms came to symbolize the pan-Indian movement of the 20th century. The many and varied Native American tribes strove to set aside their differences in order to foster a group identity—a singular dream. As such, it came to symbolize what made them one people—what united them.\nIn essence, strands can represent that which makes us who we are—that which differentiates us from what we are not—and the bonds we share with one another."

      "target": "Why do chiral clouds form? Why does timefall occur? And why does it herald the manifestation of BTs? These are questions we still struggle to answer. As we now know, BTs are beings formed of something akin to antimatter. Their first appearance coincided with the Death Stranding. Prior to that point, it is believed that there was very little in the way of antimatter present in our world at all. But we've since learned that this was far from the case, for even before the Stranding, antimatter was all around us.\nI discovered a scientific paper on the subject titled \"On Antimatter and Clouds.\" According to the paper, the gamma radiation generated by lightning strikes can trigger the formation of positrons—and indeed, particles of antimatter can be detected inside regular rainclouds. The mechanism by which they are formed is not fully understood, but the mere existence of this phenomenon is enough to suggest something intriguing. Chiral clouds contain chiralium, yes? Well, what would happen if gamma radiation were to act upon them in the same way as it does in regular clouds?\nCould chiralium excited by gamma radiation exacerbate minute distortions in space-time, somehow \"loosening\" the Seams that connect us to our Beaches? And if so, when the excited chiralium mixes with timefall and descends to the ground below, could the entire region beneath the clouds become much more strongly connected with the Beach as a result? This could well explain why BTs appear in areas prone to timefall.\nFurthermore, if the antimatter we previously thought did not even exist in any measurable quantity on Earth were, in fact, present in such commonplace phenomena as the very clouds above us, would this not lend credence to the theory that BTs, Beaches, the world of the dead—all of these things may have existed long before the Stranding?\nToo much of a theoretical leap? Perhaps. I do not deny our world changed. Drastically and irrevocably. Nevertheless, could it not be that the Death Stranding was merely the clap of thunder that brought this great change to our attention, and not the change itself?"

A collaborative investigation of the phenomenon was fundamentally impossible. But through the examination of subjects in near-death states and the cataloguing of their experiences, we have at last been able to bring the scientific method to bear on this most final of frontiers.\nEven those in a state of so-called \"\"brain death\"\" exhibit signs of consciousness. What could this possibly mean? Moreover, why do some on the brink of death report out-of-body experiences? Furthermore, why do so many of those who have such experiences describe the same sensations—of being beckoned towards a distant light? Many had argued that these commonalities were evidence of an objective reality—of a \"\"place\"\" beyond life. If nothing else, they at least suggested that death was not an instantaneous change of states, but a process.\nThe Beach has since proven much of this beyond a doubt. And the dead rising again as BTs through necrosis demonstrates this process in action. The place beyond life is no longer a theoretical possibility—its existence must be taken as incontrovertible fact."

Perhaps the closest thing we have to a working explanation of the Beach relates to the conception of a multiverse...but I digress.\nThe Beach is arguably both a concept and a reality. A discrete Beach is influenced by the mind of the associated individual, and therefore linked to them irrevocably. This is why we have so energetically pursued the psychological, psychoanalytical, and neuroscientific angles when attempting to create a unified theory of the Death Stranding, the Beach, and related phenomena.\nThere was a fad a while back in which subjects underwent counseling in order to learn more about their Beaches, and in so doing gain a greater understanding of the nature of death. DOOMS sufferers in particular provided excellent opportunities for study.\nAn interesting theoretical question arose during that period. If a person's Beach was a product of their consciousness, might animals have Beaches as well? A conundrum on the surface, perhaps, but one quickly resolved: only human corpses undergo necrosis and become BTs, which proves somewhat conclusively that only a human can possess a Beach.\nAnd yet this begs another question: if all that is required is consciousness akin to that of a human, could an AI have a Beach? An android? I, for one, do not believe so. Why? Because the function of our Beaches is to connect the worlds of the living and the dead. If an entity was never born, has not truly lived, and will never know death, surely it cannot have a Beach."

The boy would throw the spool under the bed, thus ensuring that he could not see it any more. He would then wind the thread in his hand, gradually drawing the spool back towards him until it became visible again. He repeated this process several times—it was apparently a game he played whenever his mother was elsewhere. \nFreud proposed that the process of concealing and rediscovering the spool was a coping mechanism—a way in which the boy could put his mind at ease. You see, the boy was in control of the spool. He could make it disappear and reappear at will. This helped him to comprehend his mother's absence not as something sudden or irrational, but as something controlled, and therefore not a cause for concern.\nA novelist named Franz Kafka later coined a term for this spool of thread: odradek. However, he conceived it as an object capable of speech and autonomous movement. A mysterious being neither dead nor alive.\nThe odradeks we use are perhaps not so different. These interfaces through which we experience our BBs' perception of their surroundings are not unlike spools of thread.

Accordingly, such individuals were less likely to have children or engage in sexual activity.\nIt should be noted, however, that many other unique sexual identities were being recognized during this period, such as demisexuals, who are incapable of sexual attraction without an emotional connection, and panromantics, who profess an attraction unrestricted by sex or gender—albeit one not necessarily sexual in nature.\nOne theory posits that the Stranding accelerated the proliferation of these sexualities. In a terrifying new world in which BTs roam and annihilation is an everyday occurrence, people have grown reticent to form emotional connections with others.\nAlthough there has been no measurable decrease in human fertility, the birth rate has nevertheless dropped dramatically. Incidence of sexual harassment and assault have also seen a sharp decrease, which seems to suggest that sex could not be further from our minds, for better or for worse.\nI must preempt myself by admitting that I do not have any empirical data with which to support the following claim.

Eventually they came together in communities, and then larger societies. In order to preserve and maintain these structures, humans developed a perception of time.

The question, I believe, is whether or not Sam perceived his mother's love.\nBoth Sam and the president talk about the Beach as though it were a real, physical place, but I remain convinced that it does not exist—that it is a shared delusion, and that Sam and Amelie's so-called \"visits\" are mental constructs. Sam would not necessarily be aware of this—especially if it had been \"planted\" in his mind... Such an explanation would fit with his claims that he has never been able to visit the Beach of his own volition.\nWhat if, subconsciously, Sam has developed an attachment to or longing for the Beach—one that parallels his feelings towards his sister and mother? Furthermore, what if they have all become, in essence, objects of veneration?\nUpon further consideration, it is not so hard to imagine. President Strand is an exceptional woman who exhibits panromantic qualities—as does her daughter Amelie. This is surely one of the reasons why they have been able to commit themselves so completely to the cause of American reconstruction, their one true love. Sam, on the other hand, I have diagnosed as demisexual. His sexual desires are strictly limited to those with whom he has formed an emotional connection—excepting family members like Amelie of course.\nIt is only natural to more highly regard those with whom we develop intimate emotional connections. For children, this can lead to veneration. Yet there is also an inherent contradiction in this, for divinity is distant by nature, even as we yearn to grow closer to it. I have come to the conclusion that this contradiction is at the root of Sam's aphenphosmphobia."

Just regular rain. No chiral clouds, only the traditional masses of suspended moisture, and one certainly didn't have to worry about tar bubbling up from underground—in most locales. Humans could travel anywhere, even into space, and we were blissfully unaware of the Beach's existence. Suffice it to say, there is no doubt that this is a period of sweeping change that will have lasting repercussions for all life on Earth. Given that, DOOMS may simply be humanity's way of trying to adapt and survive.\nA Beach exists within the consciousness of every individual. But these environmental changes, they affect all life on a genetic level, do they not? That is why I thought to investigate them, and the medium through which I chose to do so is the tar which has become so ubiquitous. But you're not interested in that, I am sure.\nSo you know, there is a very real possibility that we have already failed to adapt to the sixth extinction. That we are but another evolutionary dead end soon to be left behind. If that is the case, then it could be reasoned that the ones afflicted with DOOMS—and therefore blessed with an enhanced perception of the Beach—are our successors who will survive and supplant us. I suppose that would be a shame, but it doesn't trouble me all that much. My research will survive me as well, and the DOOMS sufferers can pick up from where I left off. They will carry on my genetic lineage, too, for that matter. No, what worries me is that not even DOOMS will prove sufficient to endure this extinction. If that is the case, then humanity is doomed. It's certainly a possibility we have to acknowledge.\nBut more than that, one question looms above all: why? Why now, why like this? That's what I want to know more than anything. Somehow I doubt the dinosaurs and all the other species that came and went ever considered that question. Worrying over the reason for this and that is a uniquely human condition, I suppose.

Such traumatic experiences can alter hormonal secretions, impair immune response, contribute to heart failure, and induce strokes.

If left unchecked, however, it can quickly progress a more advanced stage in which the aforementioned issues may be observed.\nThe potential impact on an individual's mental health cannot be understated. The resulting hormonal imbalances frequently lead to heightened destructive impulses towards the self and others. Those dominated by such urges are named Homo demens—the mad ones. In the case of some porters, such as MULEs, impaired memory and judgment has led them to develop an irrational obsession with their profession, hence the Homo gestalt moniker.\nWhile it should be feasible and preferable for most individuals to avoid chiral contamination at all costs, there are those with a demonstrated resistance who need not be so cautious.

The fact that each person has a Beach to which they are spiritually connected has doubtless contributed to this trend.\nThese days there are even psychotherapists who use astrological techniques in their counselling sessions. Perhaps the most interesting recent development of all, however, is the discovery that the alignment of celestial bodies at the moment of one's birth can influence one's relationship with the condition known as DOOMS.\nOf course, chiralium in the Earth's atmosphere means that it's difficult—dare I say impossible—to actually observe the constellations at any point. To come to the conclusion that they therefore have no effect upon human lives, however, would be a foolish error indeed."

Or rather, her physical body—her Ha—that was born into this world, while her spiritual essence—her Ka—was born on the Beach. Medically speaking, they weren't sure what to call it.

Amelie's physical and spiritual selves gradually came together, and her body began to develop normally.\nIt was right about then that they realized she was also a DOOMS sufferer and began to ascertain her incredible abilities.

These organisms are apparently akin to cryptobiotes, as well as the coral that is found in the Seam, in that they exist outside of time.

Blue is very much the color of death, it seems.\nCan it therefore really be a coincidence that there's no blue in an inverted rainbow? Timefall strengthens an area's connection to the Beach. This is something to do with chiral particles becoming excited, I believe. In spaces connected to the Beach, electromagnetic waves with a blue wavelength can travel easily through the Seam, leaking out onto the Beach. Some people think that's where the blue from the inverted rainbow goes. Who knows? The fact that blue has a strong connection to death, though... That much seems pretty inarguable."

His reluctance notwithstanding, he recognizes that his condition has and will continue to cause him much distress. I suspect it is rooted in a childhood trauma, but unfortunately, we have only just scratched the surface, and I cannot even begin to speculate what it might be.\nLike many of the Bridges core team members, Sam is a DOOMS sufferer. Unlike them, however, he is also a repatriate. Whether or not this is related to his aphenphosmphobia, I cannot say at this time, but he would hardly be the first to manifest phobias as a result of his abilities.\nAs an infant, Sam lost both parents and was adopted by President Strand. Owing to her stressful and time-consuming responsibilities, I can only presume that she was unable to afford him sufficient attention, which is to say that a distant relationship with his adoptive mother may be a contributing factor. As previously mentioned, though, Sam is very reluctant to talk about himself. He is an intensely private individual, and it will take time to build trust and convince him to open himself up to me."

The process is highly efficient, though some energy is lost to the production of neutrinos. Similarly, in a voidout, vast amounts of energy are released, resulting in destruction on a devastating scale which leaves behind a large crater.\nVoidouts triggered by contact with repatriates, however, consistently result in smaller craters. It is suspected that this is because energy is \"lost\" to the Beach in the same manner that it is lost to neutrino production in a conventional annihilation event, and that in the case of repatriates, the amount of energy lost is particularly high. That said, how the repatriate's body survives intact is a far bigger mystery, and one on which I will refrain from commenting until I have had the chance to examine one in the flesh.\nOne notable repatriate is Sam Strand, a former member of Bridges I who left some years ago and has been making his way in the world as a porter ever since.

But as millennia passed, Homo sapiens learned to create tools and hunt in packs.\nThe Neanderthals—who actually had larger brains than the Homo sapiens—also fashioned tools of their own, but these were crude in comparison, and developed little over 200,000 years—perhaps because these simple-minded beings favored small family units, so that even if a breakthrough occurred, it was unlikely to be shared with others. This isolation, more than any other factor, seems to have led to their decline.\nHomo sapiens, meanwhile, conceived religion, with which large numbers of individuals could be bound together in service to a common cause. Strength in numbers also made their communities more resistant to famine and other calamities. In other words, Homo sapiens grew stronger through interpersonal connections. By creating what came to be called \"society.\"\nIf we persist in our divided state, we risk losing this hard-won unity and dooming ourselves to the Neanderthals' fate. We will dwindle and die, apart and alone. But history holds another intriguing lesson—Homo sapiens did not disdain Neanderthals. The two species even intermingled on occasion.

It wasn’t anything like the dystopian surveillance state people used to worry about in the 20th century. Predictive advertising, customized health tips—that sort of thing.\nThe internet transformed our lives, and in many ways for the better. But not everyone was happy. People started to worry that it was encroaching on people’s freedoms—that the price we paid for so much convenience was constant monitoring and an abdication of control. We had become members of a \"symbiotic surveillance society.\"\nNaturally, there are people who have similar concerns about the chiral network. There’s a pretty sizable faction that wants nothing to do with it whatsoever. That said, I can’t help but feel that they’re being naive. There's no such thing as a free lunch. Connectivity and convenience have to come at a price.\nWhat’s more, the stakes are a whole lot higher nowadays. We’re not talking about a simple trade-off between privacy and convenience. It’s the network or bust—survival or extinction, as far as humanity's concerned."

An impossible claim, to say the least.\nI'm only a little older than Sam, but I was born before the Death Stranding—a fact that tends to affect the way we think about the Beach. In my professional opinion, the Beach is a figment of our collective imagination. A shared delusion. But people born later are more likely to take its existence as a given. I wonder if they find comfort in the belief because it helps to explain phenomena like BTs and repatriates like Sam?\nSimilarly, my theory is that Sam's manufactured childhood memories of the Beach are his way of coping with the fact that neither Amelie nor Bridget spent much time with him. I believe this is also the reason he still clings to the dreamcatcher Amelie gave him even now, as an adult. You could call it his security blanket. It may also be the key to overcoming his aphenphosmphobia. If Sam were to emotionally distance himself from Amelie, it might reduce his resistance to physical intimacy.

At Level I, one can \"sense\" the presence of a BT. At Level II, they can be heard, and at Level III, they can be seen.\nAs you'll have noticed, these lower levels are reserved for individuals whose abilities are entirely passive—those who possess an enhanced perspective that allows them to perceive the Beach and related phenomena. At higher levels, however, DOOMS sufferers can wield their powers more deliberately. Some, for example, are capable of traveling to and from the Beach at the time and place of their choosing.\nI should state, at this point, that there are some notable psychotherapists who dismiss such claims—who believe the Beach is nothing more than a mental construct or shared delusion. That it's all in our heads, as it were. As there are only a handful of people whose DOOMS abilities are sufficiently pronounced to prove them wrong, it is easy for naysayers to refute the existence of the Beach. If these extraordinary individuals were more common, perhaps my enlightened peers would be more hesitant to jump to conclusions. After all, Sam Strand's therapist, a noted skeptic, eventually became a convert. Though she was dealing with a rather special case—a man not only blessed with DOOMS, but the power of repatriation.

We were all aboard the Bridges train--American reconstructionism and all that--and we were happy to cooperate with them.\nThen one day we realized we weren’t just delivering documents and groceries any more. We were delivering you. BBs. Offering you up to the altar of progress, to provide the foundation for Bridges’ state-of-the-art communication network.\nIt might well have brought America closer together, but some prices aren't worth paying. We objected, but Bridges wouldn’t hear it.\nSo we took matters into our own hands. Did some digging. Learned that President Strand wasn't party to the plan. Was the VP, acting on their own initiative, most likely. Betraying Bridget and America both.\nOnce they knew we knew, they came for us. Started threatening our families. I had a husband and a newborn, and I couldn’t let any harm come to them. I had to disappear, go underground. Started going by Coffin and began recruiting like-minded patriots to form an organization to fight back against Bridges. It was my attempt at atonement, I suppose. For the part I'd played in that unconscionable evil. Soon I was training porters day and night. Teaching them how to fight and survive.\nThen, one day, I hear about this kid. A freelancer with a very unique skillset. Not DOOMS exactly, but something similar--a sixth sense for BTs.\nHe wasn’t too sure about signing up for the cause, though. His father had been a real piece of work--the kind to talk with his fists. He carried that legacy of violence, and the thought of facing more terrified him, I could tell, but...I couldn't let him walk.\nWe talked long into the night, and at the end, I looked him in the eye and said, \"A heart can only bleed so much. Gotta harden yours some if you're gonna stay unbroken.\"\nHe joined the next day.\nA porter that can track BTs. A priceless asset...\nToo many sacrifices to count. I prayed that one would be the last."

I told her once how much she was like her mother, to which she smiled and said: \"I'm like you too, daddy. I treat people real nice.\"\nAnyway, we’ve set up a new delivery base west of ground zero. Word is Bridges is planning to head to the far coast, and are looking to recruit people with DOOMS to join the caravan. I can’t be a part of a plan like that. No, I'm sticking with my own.

She and her friends'd even done some of the carting themselves. Unwittingly. The guilt was eating her alive.\nSo Bridges are using children for their own ends. Them and Daddy'd get along swell.\nNot Coffin, though. Seems she and her crew are behind the spate of recent terrorism. Not that she considers it to be terrorism, of course. Me neither.

Making deliveries that kept people alive, stepping up and doing what no one else could or would. That’s the world I grew up in. I learned that at the end of the day, it’s only people you can trust—individuals, not organizations. That’s why I want no part of your UCA or Bridges neither. Sorry, but that’s just how I feel.\nNevertheless, I will say that I am mighty grateful to you for bringing me those meds.<icon name= faceicon_good> I’m not sick or anything, just so you know. Not even injured. Just worn out. Burnt out. Fucked on a quantum level, if you like. That’s what happens when you push yourself too far, make one delivery too many.<icon name= faceicon_death> Used to be there wasn’t a single mountain I couldn’t climb. I’d even trek down south to places most porters've never even heard of, much less seen with their own two eyes. Not anymore. I’m not full-on retired or anything, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried about how much longer I can go on.\nI tell you what, though, I was doing a lot better after you dropped by to see me. Felt good to know I had a buddy out there. Someone who’d keep fighting the good fight long after I’m gone. You’ll do that for me, won’t you, Sam?<icon name=faceicon_please>\nOh, <color name=yellow>speaking of places down south, I remember that last time I was out that way, I saw something.

See what you think!<icon name= faceicon_smile>\n\n\"No one could have failed to notice the changes that have occurred in the world of logistics over the past few months. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to state that the industry is undergoing a revolution, as evidenced by the fact that so many porters have been performing admirably. The emergence of a front runner in any industry is usually followed by an increase in standards across the board, and the logistics sector is currently being transformed by a front runner unlike any other.<icon name= faceicon_good>\nI refer, of course, to Sam Bridges.\nNone can doubt his strength of will, nor his unwavering determination in the face of insurmountable odds. Though a man of few words, those present on the rare occasion he breaks his silence find his candor refreshing and welcome. He is the porter of the future, and in many ways all our fates are entwined with his. Be sure to follow his exploits in future installments of Hamamura's Porter Chronicles!\" \n<icon name= faceicon_good><icon name= faceicon_good><icon name= faceicon_good><icon name= faceicon_good><icon name= faceicon_good><icon name= faceicon_good>"

And if we need intel on the outside world, it's right there at our fingertips. On behalf of myself and everybody else here at the distro center, thanks. None of this would have been possible without you.\nFunny story—the other day I was using the network to read up on the word 'chiral' and where it comes from. Turns out it's Greek—means 'hand.' Bet you didn't know that, did you? The text went on about how your right hand is a mirror image of your left, but only if you put your palms together, and if you point them away and lay one hand on top of the other... Well, that's chirality. That's how I understood it, anyhow.\nWhat it's got to do with the network I'm not really sure. Something about routing communications through the Beach, which is basically another world like ours, but not really, so when you force elements of the two into contact, that triggers a voidout.

Deadman was none too happy about me treating you like this was your first rodeo... Man, do I feel like a dumbass! If you're the one helping us expand the network from coast to coast, we're in safe hands for sure. Guess the day America rises from the ashes might not be so far off after all!\nSo you were a member of Bridges before you were a porter. And now you're back in the shit after what, ten years? Suppose that means you outrank me...though I reckon you're not the type to care about all that.\nOut of curiosity, have you been using your private room to kick back and relax while listening to some music? The director asked us to hook you up with some tracks from Low Roar—said there's no better way to unwind after a hard day. I checked them out myself, and I have to say he knows what he's talking about. Really got the juices flowing. Oxytocin, too.\nMy favorite's a track called Pop Virus, and I think you might like it too. Apparently it's about a virus that destroys everything people think they know about music, allowing something completely new to be created in its place. Kind of like what you're doing with America, right? Taking a busted foundation and rebuilding it to make something better in the long run. Give it a listen when you have a chance!<icon name= faceicon_smile>"

So I decided it was time to come clean and tell them the whole truth about what happened five years ago—the truth about how they first met. \nMy daughter's real parents were killed by a gang of junk dealers—a gang to which her own husband used to belong. He was just a boy at the time, though, and in fact he was the one who saved her life. Somehow he convinced the others to leave her be. I still remember the way he was holding her hand when I found them. How scared she was, hood pulled over her face, unable to find the words.\nI'd tell you the boy chose to strike out on his own after that and set himself up as a prepper, but no. I won't deny it—I didn't want to take care of both of them, so I sent him on his way. It was pure chance that they met again and fell in love. Fate, maybe, though I cursed it that day, let me tell you. They didn't remember each other, you see. Trauma, I suppose, so it was my burden alone to bear. Even if I wanted to keep them apart, I wouldn't dare remind them of all that. But after everything that happened, I realized it had to be done. They both needed to remember the whole of it—that he'd saved her life, sure, but that it wouldn't've needed saving if it wasn't for his gang. Knowing the truth, could they see their way to a reconciliation?\nWell, after some talking and thinking, they told me that if you love someone, nothing else matters. Can you believe that? So I told them to give it another go. It won't be easy—and frankly, it shouldn't be—but I sincerely believe they have what it takes.

Maybe even that her sister wanted the kid all for herself.\nShe never knew about the accident. The real reason. Can't imagine how she must've felt, thinking she'd been betrayed by the one person she trusted more than anyone. Not so hard to see how that'd color her opinions on the chiral network. That's all behind her now, though. She and Mama have reconciled their differences, and maybe her faith in the ties that bind can be restored."

The poor guy lost his family in a voidout. His DOOMS abilities or level or whatever got a boost as a result, but that's hardly a bonus, especially when you consider the whole dying-every-twenty-four-minutes complication. And now he studies the Beach in the hopes of reuniting with the ones he lost someday. He uses his abilities for no one's sake but his own. That's not my assumption either—he's admitted as much himself.\nI was disgusted when I first heard that. What kind of person is blessed with such powers only to wield them for purely selfish reasons? But I was wrong, I see that now. He's experienced things beyond imagination, lives a life beyond comprehension. So he has to cope with it all in a way no one could ever understand.\nI'm no different. None of us are. All my high-minded talk about working for the good of humanity? That was just my way of coping with a grim reality. People have died for our cause. We've killed for it, too.
